# Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization

Welcome to the site for the PhD course on Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization! This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Gaussian processes and their applications in Bayesian optimization, a powerful framework for optimizing costly black-box functions.


## Gaussian Processes: Master Normality [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanUngredda/PhD_course/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FGaussian_Processes.ipynb) [![View Notebook on nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/pdf-slides-red)](https://github.com/JuanUngredda/PhD_course/blob/main/slides/Gaussian_processes.pdf) 

This session is designed to introduce Gaussian processes in a practical way. The key aspects of Gaussian process covered are: basics on the uni-multivariate normal distribution, Gaussian process regression, the covariance function (aka kernels), sampling a Gaussian process, and hyperparameter tuning. **Answers fot the lab will be posted after the session**.

## Bayesian Optimisation: Mastering Sequential Decision Making [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanUngredda/PhD_course/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FBayesian_Optimisation.ipynb) [![View Notebook on nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/pdf-slides-red)](https://github.com/JuanUngredda/PhD_course/blob/main/slides/Bayesian%20optimization.pdf) 

This session introduces Bayesian optimization to solve expensive-to-evaluate problems. The key aspects of Bayesian Optimization covered are: surrogate model, acquisition function, how to include constraints, and basics of multi-objective bayesian optimziation. **Answers fot the lab will be posted after the session**.

## Additional Resources


If you're interested in learning more about Gaussian processes, I highly recommend the book "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams. You can find the book [here](https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf).
