# Welcome to the PhD Course on Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization

Welcome to the site for the PhD course on Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization! This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Gaussian processes and their applications in Bayesian optimization, a powerful framework for optimizing costly black-box functions.

## Additional Resources


If you're interested in learning more about Gaussian processes, I highly recommend the book "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams. You can find the book [here](https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf).
