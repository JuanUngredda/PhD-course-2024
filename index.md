# Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization

Welcome to the site for the PhD course on Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization! This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Gaussian processes and their applications in Bayesian optimization, a powerful framework for optimizing costly black-box functions.

This session is designed to introduce Gaussian processes in a practical way. The key aspects of Gaussian process covered are: basics on the uni-multivariate normal distribution, Gaussian process regression, the covariance function (aka kernels), sampling a Gaussian process, and hyperparameter tuning. **Answers fot the lab will be posted after the session**.

## Additional Resources


If you're interested in learning more about Gaussian processes, I highly recommend the book "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams. You can find the book [here](https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf).
